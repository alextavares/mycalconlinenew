      "q2": "Can I calculate age between any two dates?",
      "a2": "Yes! While it defaults to calculating from birth to today, you can set any target date. This is useful for calculating age at a future date, historical age calculations, or time differences between any two events.",
      "q3": "How accurate is the age calculation?",
      "a3": "The calculation is accurate to the day. It properly handles varying month lengths (28-31 days) and leap years. The hours/minutes are based on 24-hour days and don't account for time zones or daylight saving.",
      "q4": "What do the zodiac signs mean?",
      "a4": "Zodiac signs are based on the position of the sun at your birth date. They're determined by date ranges: Aries (Mar 21-Apr 19), Taurus (Apr 20-May 20), Gemini (May 21-Jun 20), Cancer (Jun 21-Jul 22), Leo (Jul 23-Aug 22), Virgo (Aug 23-Sep 22), Libra (Sep 23-Oct 22), Scorpio (Oct 23-Nov 21), Sagittarius (Nov 22-Dec 21), Capricorn (Dec 22-Jan 19), Aquarius (Jan 20-Feb 18), Pisces (Feb 19-Mar 20).",
      "q5": "How are heartbeats estimated?",
      "a5": "We estimate heartbeats using an average resting heart rate of 72 beats per minute. This is multiplied by the total minutes you've been alive. Actual heartbeats vary based on activity level, health, and other factors.",
      "q6": "Why does my age in months not match years × 12?",
      "a6": "If you're between birthdays, you have partial months. For example, 25 years and 6 months equals 306 months total (25×12 + 6). The 'total months' shows complete months only, not including partial months."

    "differenceTitle": "Weighted vs Simple Average",
    "differenceDetail": "A simple average treats all values equally (sum ÷ count), while a weighted average considers importance. For example, if you scored 100 on a quiz worth 10% and 70 on an exam worth 90%, your simple average is 85, but your weighted average is 73 (reflecting the exam's greater importance).",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "When should I use a weighted average instead of a simple average?",
    "faqA1": "Use a weighted average when the values in your data set have different levels of importance or significance. Common examples include calculating final grades, portfolio returns, or any situation where some data points should influence the result more than others.",
    "faqQ2": "Can weights be negative?",
    "faqA2": "No, weights should be positive numbers. Negative weights don't make mathematical sense in the context of weighted averages, as they represent the importance or proportion of each value.",
    "faqQ3": "What happens if all weights are equal?",
    "faqA3": "If all weights are equal, the weighted average becomes the same as the simple arithmetic mean. The weights essentially cancel out when they're all identical.",

    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "What is a healthy BMI?",
      "a1": "A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. This range is associated with the lowest risk of weight-related health problems for most adults. However, individual factors like muscle mass and ethnicity can affect what's healthy for you.",
      "q2": "Is BMI accurate for athletes?",
      "a2": "BMI may not be accurate for athletes or highly muscular individuals. Since muscle weighs more than fat, athletic people often have a higher BMI despite having low body fat. Other measures like body fat percentage may be more useful for athletes.",
      "q3": "Does BMI apply to children?",
      "a3": "BMI for children and teens (ages 2-19) is calculated the same way but interpreted differently using age- and sex-specific percentiles. This is because body composition varies with age and between boys and girls.",
      "q4": "Can I have a normal BMI but still be unhealthy?",
      "a4": "Yes, this is called 'normal weight obesity' or being 'skinny fat.' You can have a normal BMI but high body fat percentage, especially if you're sedentary. That's why BMI should be used alongside other health indicators.",
      "q5": "How often should I check my BMI?",
      "a5": "For most adults, checking BMI once a month or every few months is sufficient. If you're actively trying to lose or gain weight, weekly weigh-ins may help track progress. Focus on trends rather than daily fluctuations.",
      "q6": "What's the difference between BMI and body fat percentage?",
      "a6": "BMI uses only height and weight to estimate body composition, while body fat percentage measures the actual proportion of fat in your body. Body fat percentage is more accurate but requires special equipment like calipers or body composition scales."

      "a2": "Check your bill carefully. If an automatic gratuity (usually 18-20%) is already added for large parties, you don't need to add another tip. However, you can add extra for exceptional service. Ask your server if unsure.",

Choose a Shorter Term</strong><ul><li>15-year mortgage vs 30-year saves huge interest</li><li>Higher monthly payment but much less total interest</li></ul><br/><strong>4. Refinance When Rates Drop</strong><ul><li>If rates drop 0.5-1%, consider refinancing</li><li>Factor in closing costs before deciding</li></ul><br/><strong>5. Make a Larger Down Payment</strong><ul><li>More down payment = smaller loan = less interest</li><li>20% down on mortgage avoids PMI</li></ul><br/><strong>Example:</strong> On a $200,000 mortgage at 6%:<br/>30 years: $1,199/mo, total interest $231,676<br/>15 years: $1,688/mo, total interest $103,788<br/><strong>Savings: $127,888!</strong>"

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "What is an amortization schedule?",
      "a1": "An amortization schedule is a table showing each loan payment broken down into principal and interest. Early payments are mostly interest; later payments are mostly principal. It helps you understand exactly where your money goes each month.",
      "q2": "Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage?",
      "a2": "A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but saves massive interest (often 50%+ less total interest). Choose 30-year if you need lower payments for cash flow, but consider paying extra when possible. Only commit to what you can comfortably afford.",
      "q3": "What is APR vs interest rate?",
      "a3": "The interest rate is the basic cost of borrowing. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) includes the interest rate PLUS fees, points, and other costs, giving you the true cost of the loan. Always compare APRs when shopping for loans.",
      "q4": "How does paying extra principal work?",
      "a4": "When you pay extra toward principal, you reduce the balance faster, which means less interest accrues. Even small extra payments early in the loan can save thousands. Always specify that extra payments go to principal, not toward future payments.",
      "q5": "What credit score do I need for a loan?",
      "a5": "Requirements vary: Mortgages typically need 620+ (740+ for best rates). Auto loans: 660+. Personal loans: 580-700+. Higher scores get significantly better rates. Check your score before applying and work on improving it if needed.",
      "q6": "Can I pay off my loan early?",
      "a6": "Usually yes, but check for prepayment penalties first. Some loans charge a fee for early payoff, especially in the first few years. Mortgages and auto loans typically allow early payoff without penalty. Always read your loan agreement."

      "q2": "Is 50% off the same as buy one get one free (BOGO)?",
      "a2": "BOGO is effectively 50% off only if you buy exactly 2 items. If you only need one item, BOGO isn't a deal at all. Always calculate the per-item cost to compare deals.",
      "q3": "How do I know if a discount is a good deal?",
      "a3": "Compare the sale price to: 1) Prices at other stores, 2) The item's usual price (not just the 'original' price shown), 3) Whether you actually need the item. A 70% discount on something you don't need is still 100% wasted money.",
      "q4": "What's the difference between 'percent off' and 'percent of'?",
      "a4": "'30% off' means you pay 70% of the original price. '30% of' means you pay only 30% (a 70% discount). They're opposites! '30% off $100' = $70. '30% of $100' = $30.",
      "q5": "How do I calculate discount from a coupon code?",
      "a5": "If the coupon is a percentage (e.g., SAVE20), apply it the same way: Original × (100% - 20%) = Final price. If it's a dollar amount (e.g., $10 OFF), simply subtract it from the total before or after other discounts as specified.",
      "q6": "Why do stores use prices like $9.99 instead of $10?",
      "a6": "This is called 'psychological pricing' or 'charm pricing.' Our brains tend to focus on the first digit, so $9.99 feels significantly cheaper than $10.00, even though it's only 1 cent less. Be aware of this when calculating true savings!"

    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "What is a good ROI?",
      "a1": "A 'good' ROI depends on the investment type and risk. For stocks, 10-12% annually is historically average. Real estate typically targets 8-12%. Any ROI above the risk-free rate (Treasury bonds ~4-5%) while accounting for risk can be considered good.",
      "q2": "How do I calculate ROI with multiple investments?",
      "a2": "Calculate ROI for each investment separately, then find the weighted average based on the amount invested in each. Alternatively, sum all initial investments and final values, then calculate total ROI.",
      "q3": "What's the difference between ROI and ROE?",
      "a3": "ROI (Return on Investment) measures the return on any investment relative to its cost. ROE (Return on Equity) specifically measures a company's profit relative to shareholders' equity. ROE is used for analyzing company performance, while ROI is more general.",
      "q4": "Should I include dividends in ROI calculation?",
      "a4": "Yes! Total return includes both capital gains (price appreciation) and income (dividends/interest). Add all dividends received to your final value before calculating ROI for an accurate picture of your investment's performance.",
      "q5": "How do taxes affect ROI?",
      "a5": "Taxes reduce your actual returns. Long-term capital gains (held >1 year) are taxed at lower rates (0-20%) than short-term gains (ordinary income rates up to 37%). Always calculate after-tax ROI for realistic expectations.",
      "q6": "What is annualized ROI and why does it matter?",
      "a6": "Annualized ROI converts any return into an equivalent yearly rate, allowing fair comparison between investments held for different periods. A 50% return over 5 years (8.45% annualized) is different from 50% over 1 year."

Get Pre-Approved:</strong> Before house hunting, get a pre-approval letter from a lender to know exactly what you can afford and show sellers you are a serious buyer.<br/><br/><strong>4.

      "q2": "How much down payment do I really need?",
      "a2": "While 20% is ideal to avoid PMI, many programs allow as little as 3% or 3.5% (FHA loans). VA loans for veterans can even be 0% down. However, a smaller down payment usually means a higher interest rate and monthly payment.",
      "q3": "Can I pay off my mortgage early?",
      "a3": "Most modern mortgages allow for extra principal payments without penalty. Paying even a small amount extra each month can shave years off your loan and save you a massive amount in interest.",
      "q4": "What is an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)?",
      "a4": "An ARM has an interest rate that stays fixed for a few years and then adjusts periodically based on market indices. They often start with lower rates than fixed mortgages but carry the risk of payments increasing significantly in the future.",

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "What if my data has no mode?",
      "a1": "If all values appear the same number of times, there is no mode. For example, in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, each number appears once, so there's no mode. This is common with continuous data like heights or weights.",
      "q2": "Can there be multiple modes?",
      "a2": "Yes! A dataset can be bimodal (two modes), trimodal (three modes), or multimodal (more than three). For example, in {1, 1, 2, 3, 3}, both 1 and 3 are modes because they each appear twice.",
      "q3": "How does the median handle even numbers of values?",
      "a3": "When there's an even count, the median is the average of the two middle values. For {2, 4, 6, 8}, the median is (4 + 6) ÷ 2 = 5, even though 5 isn't in the original data.",
      "q4": "What is the geometric mean?",
      "a4": "The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of n numbers. It's useful for averaging rates of change, percentages, or growth rates. For example, growth rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% have a geometric mean of about 19.7%.",
      "q5": "Why is median often used for income?",
      "a5": "Income data typically has a few very high earners that skew the mean upward. The median better represents what a 'typical' person earns. If Bill Gates walks into a bar, the mean income skyrockets, but the median barely changes.",
      "q6": "What is range in statistics?",
      "a6": "Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It's a simple measure of spread. For {3, 7, 12, 15}, the range is 15 - 3 = 12. While easy to calculate, it's sensitive to outliers."

      "a1": "Historical reasons! The metric system was developed in France in the 1790s for scientific standardization. The imperial system evolved from British measurements. Most countries adopted metric, but the US still primarily uses imperial units.",
      "q2": "How many feet are in a meter?",
      "a2": "1 meter = 3.28084 feet (approximately 3.28 feet). Conversely, 1 foot = 0.3048 meters exactly. This is one of the most common conversions people need.",
      "q3": "Is 1 kg equal to 2 pounds?",
      "a3": "Close, but not exactly. 1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds. So 1 kg is slightly more than 2 lbs. For rough estimates, you can use the 2:1 ratio, but for precision, use 2.2.",
      "q4": "What temperature is 0°F in Celsius?",
      "a4": "0°F = -17.78°C. This is quite cold! Fahrenheit's zero was originally based on the freezing point of brine (salt water), while Celsius uses the freezing point of pure water (0°C = 32°F).",
      "q5": "How do I remember Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion?",
      "a5": "Remember: Double the Celsius, subtract 10%, add 32. Example: 20°C → 20×2=40, minus 4 (10%)=36, plus 32=68°F. The exact answer is 68°F, so this method works well for estimates!",
      "q6": "Why does the US use imperial units?",
      "a6": "The US almost adopted the metric system in the 1790s, but the ship carrying the metric standards was captured by pirates! Later, switching became expensive and culturally resistant. Industries like construction standardized on imperial, making change difficult."

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "What is a good GPA?",
      "a1": "A 'good' GPA depends on your goals. For most purposes, 3.0+ is considered good. For competitive graduate programs or scholarships, aim for 3.5+. For honors graduation, you typically need 3.5-3.7+ (Cum Laude), 3.7-3.9+ (Magna Cum Laude), or 3.9-4.0 (Summa Cum Laude).",
      "q2": "Is a 3.5 GPA good?",
      "a2": "Yes! A 3.5 GPA is excellent and places you in approximately the top 15% of students. It qualifies you for Cum Laude honors at most universities, makes you competitive for most scholarships, and meets requirements for most graduate programs.",
      "q3": "How can I raise my GPA quickly?",
      "a3": "Focus on high-credit courses where A's will have maximum impact. If you have a low cumulative GPA from many credits, improvement will be gradual—a student with 60 credits at 2.5 GPA needs 15 credits of straight A's (4.0) to reach 2.875. Early in your academic career, GPA changes more quickly.",
      "q4": "Do all schools use a 4.0 scale?",
      "a4": "Most US colleges use the 4.0 scale, but some use 5.0 (weighted for honors/AP), 10.0, or 100-point scales. Some countries use entirely different systems (UK uses First Class/Upper Second, etc.). Always check your institution's specific grading system.",
      "q5": "What's the difference between semester and cumulative GPA?",
      "a5": "Semester GPA only includes courses from one semester (or quarter). Cumulative GPA includes all courses you've ever taken. Your transcript shows both. Most people reference cumulative GPA when asked about their GPA.",
      "q6": "Can I get into graduate school with a 3.0 GPA?",
      "a6": "Yes, but it depends on the program. Many master's programs accept 3.0+ GPAs. Competitive programs (medical, law, top MBA) typically want 3.5+. Strong GRE/GMAT scores, work experience, research, and recommendation letters can offset a lower GPA."

      "a2": "Mass is the amount of matter in an object (measured in kg), while weight is the force of gravity on that mass (technically measured in Newtons). On Earth, we use kg and lb interchangeably for weight, but in space, you'd weigh nothing while your mass stays the same!",
      "q3": "Why does the UK use stones for body weight?",
      "a3": "The stone (14 pounds) is a traditional British unit that predates the metric system. While most countries use kilograms, the UK and Ireland still commonly express body weight in stones and pounds (e.g., '10 stone 5 pounds' = 145 lb = 65.8 kg).",

      "a4": "A US ton (short ton) = 2,000 pounds = 907.185 kg. A metric tonne = 1,000 kg = 2,204.62 pounds. The metric tonne is about 10% heavier. There's also the UK/long ton = 2,240 pounds, used in shipping.",
      "q5": "How do I convert ounces to grams for cooking?",
      "a5": "Multiply ounces by 28.35 to get grams. Common conversions: 1 oz = 28g, 4 oz = 113g (1/4 lb), 8 oz = 227g (1/2 lb), 16 oz = 454g (1 lb). For precision baking, use a digital kitchen scale.",
      "q6": "Is 1 kg of feathers heavier than 1 kg of steel?",
      "a6": "They weigh exactly the same - 1 kilogram! This classic riddle tricks people because we intuitively think of steel as 'heavier' than feathers. The difference is density: you'd need a much larger volume of feathers to reach 1 kg compared to steel."

      "q1": "How do I know if three sides can form a triangle?",
      "a1": "Use the triangle inequality theorem: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. For example, sides 3, 4, 5 work because 3+4 > 5, 3+5 > 4, and 4+5 > 3. But 1, 2, 10 don't work because 1+2 < 10.",
      "q2": "What's the difference between SSS, SAS, and ASA?",
      "a2": "SSS = all three sides known. SAS = two sides and the angle between them. ASA = two angles and the side between them. These are the minimum information needed to uniquely determine a triangle. There's also AAS (two angles and a non-included side) and HL (hypotenuse-leg for right triangles).",
      "q3": "Why do all triangle angles add up to 180°?",
      "a3": "This is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry (flat surfaces). If you draw a triangle on a flat surface and measure the angles with a protractor, they'll always sum to 180°. On curved surfaces (spheres or saddles), this isn't true - spherical triangles have angles that sum to more than 180°!",
      "q4": "How do I find the area without the height?",
      "a4": "Use Heron's formula if you know all three sides: First calculate s = (a+b+c)/2, then Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]. Or if you know two sides and the angle between them, use Area = (1/2)ab·sin(C).",
      "q5": "What is a right triangle?",
      "a5": "A right triangle has one 90° angle. The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse (the longest side). Right triangles follow the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c². Common examples include 3-4-5, 5-12-13, and 8-15-17 triangles.",
      "q6": "Can I use degrees or radians?",
      "a6": "This calculator uses degrees (°) for all angle measurements. To convert: radians × (180/π) = degrees, or degrees × (π/180) = radians. Most everyday applications use degrees (90° for a right angle), while advanced math and physics often use radians (π/2 for a right angle)."

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "What is a normal inflation rate?",
      "a1": "Most central banks (like the US Federal Reserve) target around 2% annual inflation. This is considered healthy for a growing economy. Historical US inflation has averaged about 3-3.5% since 1913. Rates of 1-3% are generally considered low and stable.",
      "q2": "Why does inflation happen?",
      "a2": "Inflation occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds supply (demand-pull), when production costs increase (cost-push), or when the money supply grows faster than economic output. Government policies, international events, and market speculation also play roles.",
      "q3": "How is inflation measured?",
      "a3": "The most common measure is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the average change in prices for a basket of consumer goods and services (food, housing, transportation, medical care, etc.). Other measures include the Producer Price Index (PPI) and PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures).",
      "q4": "What's the difference between inflation and deflation?",
      "a4": "Inflation is when prices rise and purchasing power falls. Deflation is the opposite - when prices fall and purchasing power increases. While deflation sounds good, it can be harmful because consumers delay purchases expecting lower prices, which hurts the economy.",
      "q5": "How do I protect my money from inflation?",
      "a5": "Invest in assets that typically outpace inflation: stocks (historically ~10% annual returns), real estate, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), commodities, or I-Bonds. Keep only emergency funds in cash. Diversification is key to managing inflation risk.",
      "q6": "Is 3% inflation the same every year?",
      "a6": "No. The 3% is an average - actual inflation varies yearly. The US had near 0% in 2015, 1.4% in 2020, but 8% in 2022. When using this calculator for long periods, use the average historical rate for that timeframe, not a single year's rate."

      "a1": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (longest side, opposite the right angle) equals the sum of squares of the two legs: a² + b² = c². It only works for right triangles (triangles with one 90° angle).",
      "q2": "What is a Pythagorean triple?",
      "a2": "A Pythagorean triple is a set of three positive integers (a, b, c) that satisfy a² + b² = c². Famous examples include 3-4-5, 5-12-13, and 8-15-17. Any multiple of a triple is also a triple (e.g., 6-8-10 from 3-4-5).",
      "q3": "Why must the hypotenuse be the longest side?",
      "a3": "By definition, the hypotenuse is opposite the largest angle (90°). In any triangle, the longest side is always opposite the largest angle. If you try to use a shorter side as the hypotenuse, the math won't work (you'd get a negative number under the square root).",
      "q4": "Can the Pythagorean theorem work with any triangle?",
      "a4": "No, the classic a² + b² = c² only works for right triangles (90° angle). For other triangles, you need the Law of Cosines: c² = a² + b² - 2ab·cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c. When C = 90°, cos(90°) = 0, giving us the Pythagorean theorem.",
      "q5": "How do I find the distance between two points?",
      "a5": "The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem! For points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂): distance = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]. The horizontal and vertical differences are the legs, and the distance is the hypotenuse.",
      "q6": "What is the 3D Pythagorean theorem?",
      "a6": "In 3D space, the diagonal of a rectangular box with sides a, b, c is: d = √(a² + b² + c²). This is an extension of the 2D theorem. For example, a room 3m × 4m × 12m has a diagonal of √(9+16+144) = √169 = 13 meters."

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "Are these numbers truly random?",
      "a1": "These are pseudo-random numbers generated by an algorithm. They're random enough for games, sampling, and everyday use, but not cryptographically secure. For security applications (passwords, encryption), use specialized tools.",
      "q2": "Can I generate decimal numbers?",
      "a2": "This generator produces whole numbers (integers) only. For decimal random numbers, you could generate a larger range and divide. For example, generate 1-100 and divide by 10 for one decimal place (0.1 to 10.0).",
      "q3": "Why use 'Unique List' instead of 'Multiple Numbers'?",
      "a3": "Use 'Unique List' when you need distinct numbers without any repeats - like drawing lottery numbers, picking raffle winners, or assigning unique IDs. Note: you can't generate more unique numbers than exist in your range.",
      "q4": "What dice types are available?",
      "a4": "D4 (4-sided), D6 (standard 6-sided), D8, D10, D12, D20 (popular in D&D), and D100 (percentile). You can roll multiple dice at once and see both individual results and the total.",
      "q5": "Is there a limit to how many numbers I can generate?",
      "a5": "For performance, we limit multiple number generation to 1,000 numbers at once. For unique lists, you're limited by the range size - you can't pick 100 unique numbers from a 1-50 range.",
      "q6": "Why do I get different numbers each time?",
      "a6": "That's the point of randomness! The generator starts with a different seed each time, producing unpredictable sequences. If you need reproducible 'random' numbers for testing, you'd need a seeded random number generator."

    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "Should I include or exclude the end date?",
      "a1": "Include the end date when counting complete days (vacation days, rental periods, age in days). Exclude it when measuring time elapsed since an event (days since a birthday, time since a purchase). The choice depends on whether the end date is a 'full' day or just a cutoff point.",
      "q2": "How do you count weekdays vs weekends?",
      "a2": "Weekdays are Monday through Friday (5 days per week). Weekends are Saturday and Sunday (2 days per week). We check each date in the range to give you an exact count, accounting for partial weeks at the start and end of your date range.",
      "q3": "Why is 'months' an approximation?",
      "a3": "Months have different lengths (28-31 days), so there's no exact 'days per month' value. We use the average month length of 30.437 days. For precise month calculations between specific dates, our breakdown shows exact years, months, and days.",
      "q4": "Does this account for leap years?",
      "a4": "Yes! The calculator uses actual calendar dates, so February 29 is correctly counted in leap years. The average year length (365.25 days) also accounts for the extra leap day every 4 years.",
      "q5": "What's the maximum date range I can calculate?",
      "a5": "You can calculate any date range your browser's date picker supports - typically from year 0001 to 9999. The calculator handles spans of thousands of years accurately.",
      "q6": "How do I calculate business days only?",
      "a6": "Look at the 'Weekdays' result, which shows Monday-Friday count. For more precise business day calculations that exclude holidays, you'd need to use a specialized business day calculator with a holiday calendar for your region."

For example, if a recipe requires 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, the ratio is 2:3. Ratios are used in cooking, mixing paints, calculating speeds, comparing prices, and many other real-world applications.",
    "howToTitle": "How to Calculate with Ratios",
    "howToDetail": "There are several ways to work with ratios: 1) Simplifying: Divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD) to get the simplest form. 2) Equivalent Ratios: Multiply or divide both parts by the same number to find equivalent ratios. 3) Comparing: Convert ratios to decimals or find a common denominator to compare. 4) Dividing: To split a total amount in a given ratio, divide the total by the sum of ratio parts, then multiply by each part.",
    "examplesTitle": "Ratio Examples",
    "example1Title": "Simplifying a Ratio",
    "example1Detail": "To simplify 8:12, find the GCD of 8 and 12, which is 4. Divide both by 4: 8÷4 = 2 and 12÷4 = 3. The simplified ratio is 2:3.",
    "example2Title": "Finding Equivalent Ratio",
    "example2Detail": "If 2:3 = 6:x, cross-multiply: 2x = 3×6, so 2x = 18, therefore x = 9. The equivalent ratio is 6:9.",

    "example3Detail": "Sum of parts = 2+3 = 5. First part = (2/5)×100 = $40. Second part = (3/5)×100 = $60. Total check: $40 + $60 = $100 ✓",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What is the difference between a ratio and a fraction?",
    "faqA1": "A ratio compares two or more quantities (like 2:3), while a fraction represents a part of a whole (like 2/3). Ratios can be written as fractions, but they have different meanings. A ratio shows relative sizes, while a fraction shows a portion of something.",
    "faqQ2": "How do you simplify a ratio?",
    "faqA2": "To simplify a ratio, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers in the ratio, then divide each number by the GCD. For example, 10:15 simplified: GCD is 5, so 10÷5:15÷5 = 2:3.",
    "faqQ3": "What does a ratio of 1:1 mean?",
    "faqA3": "A ratio of 1:1 (also written as 1 to 1) means both quantities are equal. For example, if mixing two liquids in a 1:1 ratio, you use equal amounts of each. It's the simplest ratio possible.",
    "faqQ4": "How do you find a missing value in a proportion?",
    "faqA4": "Use cross-multiplication. If a:b = c:x, then a×x = b×c, so x = (b×c)/a. For example, if 2:3 = 4:x, then x = (3×4)/2 = 6.",
    "faqQ5": "Can ratios have more than two numbers?",
    "faqA5": "Yes! Ratios can compare 3 or more quantities. For example, 2:3:5 means for every 2 parts of the first, there are 3 parts of the second and 5 parts of the third. To divide $100 in ratio 2:3:5, sum=10, so parts are $20, $30, and $50.",
    "faqQ6": "What is the golden ratio?",
    "faqA6": "The golden ratio is approximately 1.618:1 (or 1:1.618), denoted by the Greek letter φ (phi). It appears frequently in nature, art, and architecture and is considered aesthetically pleasing. It's calculated as (1+√5)/2."

Numbers are written as a × 10^n, where 'a' is a coefficient between 1 and 10, and 'n' is an integer exponent. For example, 300,000 is written as 3 × 10^5, and 0.00045 is written as 4.5 × 10^-4. This notation is widely used in science, engineering, and mathematics to make calculations with extreme values more manageable.",
    "howToTitle": "How to Use Scientific Notation",
    "howToDetail": "To convert to scientific notation: 1) Move the decimal point until you have a number between 1 and 10. 2) Count how many places you moved - this is your exponent. 3) If you moved left, the exponent is positive; if right, negative. To convert back to decimal: multiply the coefficient by 10 raised to the exponent power. For operations: multiply/divide by adding/subtracting exponents (when bases are the same), or convert to decimal first for addition/subtraction.",

    "faqQ3": "Can the coefficient be negative in scientific notation?",
    "faqA3": "Yes! The coefficient can be positive or negative. For example, -4.5 × 10^3 = -4,500. The sign of the coefficient indicates whether the overall number is positive or negative, while the exponent shows the magnitude.",
    "faqQ4": "How do you add numbers in scientific notation?",
    "faqA4": "To add or subtract, the exponents must be the same. Either adjust one number to match the other's exponent, or convert both to decimal, perform the operation, then convert back. For example, (2 × 10^3) + (3 × 10^2) = (2 × 10^3) + (0.3 × 10^3) = 2.3 × 10^3.",
    "faqQ5": "What does a negative exponent mean?",
    "faqA5": "A negative exponent means the number is less than 1 (a decimal). For example, 10^-3 = 0.001. The negative exponent tells you how many places to move the decimal point to the left. So 4.5 × 10^-2 = 0.045.",
    "faqQ6": "Why is scientific notation important in science?",
    "faqA6": "Scientific notation is essential in science because it allows us to work with the extreme scales found in nature - from subatomic particles (10^-15 m) to galaxies (10^21 m). It makes calculations clearer, reduces errors from writing many zeros, and helps maintain precision in measurements."

For example, 2^3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. Exponents are fundamental in mathematics, science, and engineering for expressing very large or very small numbers efficiently. Special cases include: any number to the power of 0 equals 1 (e.g., 5^0 = 1), any number to the power of 1 equals itself (e.g., 7^1 = 7), and negative exponents represent fractions (e.g., 2^-3 = 1/8).",

    "faqQ2": "What is the difference between square root and cube root?",
    "faqA2": "A square root (²√ or √) asks 'what number multiplied by itself gives this?' For example, √16 = 4 because 4 × 4 = 16. A cube root (³√) asks 'what number multiplied by itself three times gives this?' For example, ³√27 = 3 because 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. Generally, an nth root asks for n multiplications.",
    "faqQ3": "How do you calculate logarithms?",
    "faqA3": "A logarithm answers the question: 'What power do I raise the base to get this number?' For example, log₂(8) = 3 because 2^3 = 8. Common logarithm bases are 10 (log₁₀, called 'log') and e (logₑ, called 'ln' or natural log). If log₁₀(100) = 2, it means 10^2 = 100.",

    "faqA4": "Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. For example, 5^0 = 1, 100^0 = 1, even (-3)^0 = 1. This is because of the exponent rule: a^(m-m) = a^m / a^m = 1, and m - m = 0. Note: 0^0 is mathematically undefined.",
    "faqQ5": "How do you multiply numbers with exponents?",
    "faqA5": "When multiplying numbers with the same base, add the exponents: a^m × a^n = a^(m+n). For example, 2^3 × 2^4 = 2^(3+4) = 2^7 = 128. When dividing, subtract exponents: a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n). For example, 3^5 ÷ 3^2 = 3^(5-2) = 3^3 = 27.",

    "whatIs": "What is Compound Interest?",
    "whatIsContent": "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Unlike simple interest (calculated only on principal), compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time. Albert Einstein allegedly called it 'the eighth wonder of the world,' saying 'He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it.' The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is principal, r is annual rate, n is compounding frequency per year, and t is time in years.",
    "howToCalculate": "How to Calculate Compound Interest",
    "howToCalculateContent": "To calculate compound interest: (1) Determine your principal amount (initial investment), (2) Find your annual interest rate as a decimal (5% = 0.05), (3) Decide how often interest compounds (monthly = 12 times per year, daily = 365), (4) Determine the time period in years. Apply the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). For example, $1,000 at 5% compounded monthly for 10 years: A = 1000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12×10) = $1,647.01. If you add monthly contributions, use the annuity formula for the additional amount: FV = PMT × [((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)].",
    "benefits": "Benefits of Compound Interest",
    "benefitsContent": "Compound interest is powerful for long-term wealth building: (1) Exponential Growth: Your money grows faster over time as interest earns interest. (2) Time Advantage: Starting early dramatically increases returns - a 25-year-old investing $200/month at 7% will have $528,000 by 65, while starting at 35 yields only $244,000. (3) Passive Income: Once invested, your money works for you automatically. (4) Inflation Protection: Returns often outpace inflation, preserving purchasing power. (5) Retirement Security: Regular contributions with compound interest can build substantial retirement funds. The key is consistency and time - even small amounts grow significantly over decades.",
    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What's the difference between compound and simple interest?",
    "faqA1": "Simple interest is calculated only on the principal: I = P × r × t. For $1,000 at 5% for 10 years, you earn $500 total. Compound interest includes interest on previously earned interest, growing exponentially. The same investment compounded annually yields $628.89 in interest - 26% more! The difference becomes dramatic over longer periods.",
    "faqQ2": "How often should interest compound for best returns?",
    "faqA2": "More frequent compounding yields higher returns. Daily compounding (365 times/year) earns slightly more than monthly (12 times), which beats annual (1 time). However, the difference is small - for $10,000 at 5% over 10 years: annually = $16,289, monthly = $16,470, daily = $16,487. The compounding frequency matters less than the interest rate and time invested.",
    "faqQ3": "What is the Rule of 72?",
    "faqA3": "The Rule of 72 estimates how long it takes to double your money: divide 72 by your interest rate. At 6% annual return, your money doubles in approximately 72 ÷ 6 = 12 years. At 9%, it doubles in 8 years (72 ÷ 9). This quick mental math helps you understand investment growth without complex calculations.",
    "faqQ4": "Should I make monthly contributions or lump sum investments?",
    "faqA4": "Both are valuable! Lump sum investments have more time to compound, but monthly contributions (dollar-cost averaging) are practical for most people and reduce market timing risk. Example: $10,000 lump sum at 7% for 30 years = $76,123. Contributing $27.78/month ($10,000 total) over 30 years = $34,003. The lump sum wins, but monthly contributions are easier to maintain and build discipline.",
    "faqQ5": "How does compound interest affect debt?",
    "faqA5": "Compound interest works against you in debt! Credit cards often compound daily at high rates (18-24% APR). A $5,000 balance at 20% APR with minimum payments can take 20+ years and cost $8,000+ in interest. This is why paying off high-interest debt should precede investing - you're 'earning' the interest rate by avoiding it.",
    "faqQ6": "What's a realistic annual return for investments?",
    "faqA6": "Historical stock market returns (S&P 500) average about 10% annually before inflation, or ~7% after inflation. Conservative estimates use 6-8% for long-term planning. Bonds yield 3-5%, savings accounts 1-3%. High-yield savings might offer 4-5%. Use realistic rates in your calculations - assuming 15%+ is overly optimistic and can lead to undersaving for goals."

    "whatIsContent": "GCD (Greatest Common Divisor), also called HCF (Highest Common Factor), is the largest positive integer that divides all given numbers without a remainder. For example, GCD(12, 18) = 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 evenly. LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all given numbers. For example, LCM(12, 18) = 36 because 36 is the smallest number that both 12 and 18 divide evenly. These concepts are fundamental in number theory, fractions, and many practical applications.",
    "howToCalculate": "How to Calculate GCD and LCM",
    "howToCalculateContent": "GCD can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm: repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller and replace the larger with the remainder until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD. For example, GCD(48, 18): 48 = 18×2 + 12, then 18 = 12×1 + 6, then 12 = 6×2 + 0, so GCD = 6. LCM can be calculated using the formula: LCM(a,b) = (a × b) / GCD(a,b). For example, LCM(12, 18) = (12 × 18) / 6 = 216 / 6 = 36. For more than 2 numbers, find GCD or LCM of the first two, then combine with the third, and so on.",
    "commonUses": "Common Uses of GCD and LCM",

LCM is essential for adding/subtracting fractions with different denominators (find LCM of denominators), scheduling problems (when will two recurring events coincide?), pattern repetition, and synchronization tasks. For example, if buses arrive every 12 and 18 minutes, they'll arrive together every LCM(12,18) = 36 minutes. In music, LCM helps find when different rhythmic patterns align.",
    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What's the difference between GCD and LCM?",
    "faqA1": "GCD is the largest number that divides all given numbers (a divisor, so it's ≤ the smallest number). LCM is the smallest number divisible by all given numbers (a multiple, so it's ≥ the largest number). For 12 and 18: GCD = 6 (divides both), LCM = 36 (divisible by both). They're inversely related: smaller GCD means larger LCM.",
    "faqQ2": "How do you find GCD of more than 2 numbers?",

    "faqQ3": "What if the GCD is 1?",
    "faqA3": "If GCD = 1, the numbers are called 'coprime' or 'relatively prime' - they share no common factors except 1. For example, GCD(15, 28) = 1 because 15 = 3×5 and 28 = 2²×7 have no common prime factors. When numbers are coprime, LCM(a,b) = a×b.",

    "faqQ6": "Can GCD and LCM be calculated for decimals?",
    "faqA6": "GCD and LCM are defined only for positive integers. For decimals, you can convert to fractions first. For example, to find GCD(0.6, 0.9): convert to 6/10 and 9/10, then GCD(6,9) = 3, so the answer is 3/10 = 0.3. Or multiply by a power of 10 to make them integers, calculate, then divide back."

It's calculated using the formula: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) × 100. A positive result indicates an increase, while a negative result indicates a decrease. For example, if a stock price increases from $100 to $150, the percentage change is +50% because it grew by $50, which is 50% of the original $100. This metric is essential for understanding growth rates, price changes, and comparing changes across different scales.",
    "howToCalculate": "How to Calculate Percentage Change",
    "howToCalculateContent": "To calculate percentage change: (1) Subtract the old value from the new value to find the absolute change, (2) Divide the absolute change by the old value (the original amount), (3) Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage. For example, if sales increase from 200 to 250 units: Change = 250 - 200 = 50, then 50 / 200 = 0.25, finally 0.25 × 100 = 25% increase. For a decrease, the result will be negative. If a price drops from $80 to $60: Change = 60 - 80 = -20, then -20 / 80 = -0.25, finally -0.25 × 100 = -25% (a 25% decrease).",

It allows fair comparison across different scales - a $10 price increase on a $20 item (50%) is more significant than the same $10 increase on a $1,000 item (1%). This metric helps identify trends, measure performance, and make informed decisions based on relative rather than absolute changes.",
    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What's the difference between percentage change and percentage difference?",
    "faqA1": "Percentage change compares a new value to an old value, showing how much something has increased or decreased from a starting point. It's directional (can be positive or negative). Percentage difference compares two values without implying which came first, calculated as |A - B| / ((A + B)/2) × 100. Use percentage change for time-series data (before/after), and percentage difference for comparing two independent values.",
    "faqQ2": "Can percentage change be greater than 100%?",
    "faqA2": "Yes! A percentage change greater than 100% means the value more than doubled. For example, if something increases from 50 to 150, the change is (150-50)/50 × 100 = 200% - it tripled (increased by 200% of the original). A 100% increase means doubling, 200% means tripling, 300% means quadrupling, and so on.",
    "faqQ3": "Why can't the old value be zero?",
    "faqA3": "Division by zero is mathematically undefined. The formula requires dividing by the old value, so if it's zero, the calculation is impossible. For example, going from 0 to 100 doesn't have a meaningful percentage change because there's no baseline to compare against. In such cases, describe the change differently (e.g., 'increased from 0 to 100' or 'started at 100').",
    "faqQ4": "How do you calculate percentage decrease?",
    "faqA4": "Use the same formula as percentage increase. The result will automatically be negative, indicating a decrease. For example, from 200 to 150: (150-200)/200 × 100 = -25%. Some prefer to report this as '25% decrease' (dropping the negative sign), while others keep it as '-25%' to show direction. Both are correct - choose based on context.",
    "faqQ5": "What if the change is negative to positive (or vice versa)?",
    "faqA5": "The formula still works, but results can be counterintuitive. From -50 to +50: (50-(-50))/-50 × 100 = -200% (a decrease, even though the value went up). This happens because you're dividing by a negative number. For values crossing zero, percentage change is often misleading - use absolute change or describe the situation qualitatively instead.",
    "faqQ6": "How do you reverse a percentage change?",
    "faqA6": "If something increased by X%, divide by (1 + X/100) to get back. If it decreased by X%, divide by (1 - X/100). For example, if a price increased 25% to $125, the original was $125 / 1.25 = $100. Note: a 50% increase followed by a 50% decrease doesn't return to the original - you end up 25% lower (100 → 150 → 75)."

    "whatIs": "What is Body Fat Percentage?",
    "whatIsContent": "Body fat percentage is the proportion of your total body weight that consists of fat tissue. It's a more accurate indicator of health and fitness than weight alone because it distinguishes between fat mass and lean mass (muscles, bones, organs). Essential fat is necessary for normal body functions - men need at least 2-5% and women need 10-13%. Beyond essential fat, the amount you carry affects your health, appearance, and athletic performance. Athletes typically have lower body fat (6-13% for men, 14-20% for women), while acceptable ranges for general health are 18-24% for men and 25-31% for women.",
    "howToMeasure": "How to Measure for the Navy Method",
    "howToMeasureContent": "For accurate results with the Navy method, use a soft tape measure and measure at these specific points: NECK - Measure just below the larynx (Adam's apple), keeping the tape level. WAIST - For men, measure at the navel level. For women, measure at the narrowest point of the waist. HIP (women only) - Measure at the widest point of the hips and buttocks. Take measurements in the morning before eating, standing relaxed but not sucking in. Measure each point 2-3 times and use the average. Pull the tape snug but not tight enough to compress the skin.",
    "categoriesTitle": "Body Fat Categories",
    "categoriesContent": "Body fat is categorized differently for men and women due to physiological differences. ESSENTIAL FAT (Men: 2-5%, Women: 10-13%): The minimum required for basic physical and physiological health. Going below this is dangerous. ATHLETES (Men: 6-13%, Women: 14-20%): Typical for competitive athletes and those who train intensively. FITNESS (Men: 14-17%, Women: 21-24%): Healthy range for regular exercisers with visible muscle definition. ACCEPTABLE (Men: 18-24%, Women: 25-31%): Average healthy range for most adults. OBESE (Men: 25%+, Women: 32%+): Associated with increased health risks including diabetes, heart disease, and metabolic disorders.",
    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "How accurate is this body fat calculator?",
    "faqA1": "The US Navy method is accurate within 3-4% when measurements are taken correctly. It's more accurate than BMI-based estimates but less precise than methods like DEXA scans or hydrostatic weighing. The BMI-based formula provides a rough estimate and can be off by 5-10%, especially for muscular individuals or those with unusual body compositions.",
    "faqQ2": "Why is body fat percentage better than BMI?",
    "faqA2": "BMI only considers height and weight, so it can't distinguish between muscle and fat. A muscular athlete might have a 'overweight' BMI despite having low body fat. Conversely, someone with little muscle ('skinny fat') might have normal BMI but high body fat. Body fat percentage directly measures what matters for health - the proportion of fat tissue in your body.",
    "faqQ3": "What's the ideal body fat percentage?",
    "faqA3": "It depends on your goals. For general health, 10-20% for men and 18-28% for women is considered healthy. For visible abs, men typically need 10-14% and women 16-20%. Athletes often maintain 6-13% (men) or 14-20% (women) for performance. Very low body fat (below essential levels) is dangerous and unsustainable.",
    "faqQ4": "Why do women have higher body fat percentages?",
    "faqA4": "Women naturally carry more essential fat for reproductive functions, breast tissue, and hormonal regulation. This biological difference means healthy body fat ranges are 8-10% higher for women than men. A woman at 25% body fat and a man at 15% body fat are considered comparably fit.",
    "faqQ5": "How can I reduce my body fat percentage?",
    "faqA5": "Create a moderate caloric deficit (300-500 calories below maintenance) through diet and exercise. Prioritize protein intake (0.7-1g per pound of body weight) to preserve muscle. Include resistance training to build/maintain muscle while losing fat. Add cardio for extra calorie burn. Sleep 7-9 hours and manage stress, as both affect fat storage. Avoid crash diets which cause muscle loss and metabolic adaptation.",
    "faqQ6": "Why does the Navy method need neck measurements?",
    "faqA6": "The Navy formula accounts for how fat distributes across the body. Neck circumference helps calibrate the calculation because people with larger necks relative to their waist tend to have more lean mass. This adjustment improves accuracy compared to using waist measurement alone. The formula was developed by the US Navy in 1984 and is still used by military organizations worldwide."

    "whatIs": "What are Time Zones?",
    "whatIsContent": "Time zones are regions of the Earth that observe a uniform standard time. The world is divided into 24 primary time zones, each approximately 15 degrees of longitude wide, corresponding to one hour of time difference. Time zones are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), with zones ranging from UTC-12 to UTC+14. Countries may adjust their time zones for political or practical reasons, and some use 30 or 45-minute offsets. Daylight Saving Time (DST) further complicates time zones, as many regions shift their clocks forward by one hour during summer months.",
    "howToConvert": "How to Convert Time Zones",
    "howToConvertContent": "To convert time between zones: 1) Find the UTC offset for both time zones, 2) Calculate the difference between the offsets, 3) Add or subtract this difference from your starting time. For example, to convert 3:00 PM in New York (UTC-5) to London (UTC+0): The difference is 5 hours, so add 5 hours to get 8:00 PM in London. Be careful when crossing midnight - you may need to change the date. During DST periods, remember that offsets change (e.g., New York becomes UTC-4 in summer).",
    "commonConversions": "Common Time Zone Conversions",
    "commonConversionsContent": "Popular conversions include: New York to London (+5 hours), Los Angeles to New York (+3 hours), London to Tokyo (+9 hours), and Sydney to London (-10/11 hours depending on DST). Business hours overlap is crucial for international meetings: when it's 9 AM in New York, it's 2 PM in London, 3 PM in Paris, 10 PM in Tokyo, and midnight in Sydney. The International Date Line (roughly along 180° longitude) is where the calendar date changes - crossing westward adds a day, eastward subtracts a day.",
    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What is UTC and why is it important?",
    "faqA1": "UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks. It replaced GMT as the world's reference time in 1972. UTC doesn't observe Daylight Saving Time, making it a stable reference. All time zones are defined as offsets from UTC (e.g., UTC-5 for New York, UTC+9 for Tokyo). Using UTC as a common reference simplifies international coordination, aviation, computing, and telecommunications.",
    "faqQ2": "How does Daylight Saving Time affect time zones?",
    "faqA2": "DST shifts clocks forward by one hour in spring and back in fall, changing the UTC offset. Not all countries observe DST, and those that do may switch on different dates. For example, the US shifts in March/November while Europe shifts in late March/October. Some regions in the same country observe DST while others don't (like Arizona in the US). This can change time differences between cities temporarily - New York and London are 5 hours apart most of the year but only 4 hours during the brief periods when one has switched but the other hasn't.",
    "faqQ3": "Why do some time zones have 30 or 45-minute offsets?",
    "faqA3": "Some countries adopted non-standard offsets for historical, geographical, or political reasons. India uses UTC+5:30 to have a single time zone for the entire country while being centered between neighboring zones. Nepal uses UTC+5:45 as a symbol of independence from India. Iran uses UTC+3:30, and Afghanistan uses UTC+4:30. Australia's Northern Territory uses UTC+9:30. These half-hour or quarter-hour offsets help certain regions align better with their solar time.",
    "faqQ4": "What is the International Date Line?",
    "faqA4": "The International Date Line (IDL) is an imaginary line running roughly along 180° longitude in the Pacific Ocean. When you cross it going west, you add one day; going east, you subtract one day. This prevents confusion that would occur if you could travel around the world and arrive on a different date. The line isn't straight - it zigzags to keep certain island nations and regions on the same day as their trading partners or parent countries.",
    "faqQ5": "How do I schedule meetings across multiple time zones?",
    "faqA5": "Find overlapping business hours by comparing time zones. Tools like this converter help identify when it's reasonable hours for all parties. For US-Europe calls, morning US time (9-11 AM ET) works well, as it's afternoon in Europe. US-Asia calls are trickier - early morning US or late evening Asia often works. Consider rotating meeting times to share the inconvenience. Always specify the time zone when sending invitations, and use calendar apps that automatically convert times.",
    "faqQ6": "Why does China have only one time zone?",
    "faqA6": "Despite spanning five geographical time zones, China uses a single time zone (UTC+8, Beijing Time) nationwide since 1949 for national unity and administrative simplicity. This means when it's noon in Beijing, it's also officially noon in western regions like Xinjiang, even though solar noon there occurs around 3 PM Beijing time. Some western regions unofficially use 'Xinjiang Time' (UTC+6) in daily life, especially among Uyghur communities, while businesses and government operate on Beijing Time."

    "whatIs": "What is a Quadratic Equation?",
    "whatIsContent": "A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. The term 'quadratic' comes from 'quadratus,' the Latin word for square. Quadratic equations always have exactly two solutions (roots), which may be real or complex numbers. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola - opening upward if a > 0 or downward if a < 0. Quadratic equations appear throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, and economics, modeling everything from projectile motion to profit optimization.",
    "formulaTitle": "The Quadratic Formula",
    "formulaContent": "The quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a gives the solutions to any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0. The ± symbol means there are two solutions: one using addition and one using subtraction. This formula was known to ancient Babylonians around 2000 BCE, though they used geometric methods. The modern algebraic form was developed by Indian and Islamic mathematicians. The formula works for all quadratic equations, including those with complex solutions when the discriminant is negative.",
    "discriminantTitle": "Understanding the Discriminant",
    "discriminantContent": "The discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac determines the nature of the roots without calculating them. If Δ > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots (the parabola crosses the x-axis twice). If Δ = 0, there's exactly one real root with multiplicity 2 (the parabola touches the x-axis at its vertex). If Δ < 0, the roots are complex conjugates (the parabola doesn't cross the x-axis). The discriminant also indicates whether a quadratic expression can be factored over the real numbers: it factors nicely if Δ is a perfect square.",
    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What if my quadratic equation has complex roots?",
    "faqA1": "Complex roots occur when the discriminant (b² - 4ac) is negative. The solutions will be in the form a ± bi, where i = √(-1) is the imaginary unit. Complex roots always come in conjugate pairs - if 3 + 2i is a root, then 3 - 2i is also a root. While complex numbers may seem abstract, they're essential in electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, and signal processing. The parabola doesn't cross the x-axis when roots are complex.",
    "faqQ2": "How do I find the vertex of a parabola?",
    "faqA2": "The vertex of y = ax² + bx + c is at the point (-b/2a, f(-b/2a)), where f(-b/2a) = c - b²/4a. The x-coordinate -b/2a is also the axis of symmetry. If a > 0, the vertex is the minimum point; if a < 0, it's the maximum. The vertex form of a quadratic is y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. You can convert between standard and vertex forms by completing the square.",
    "faqQ3": "Can I solve quadratic equations without the formula?",
    "faqA3": "Yes! Methods include: (1) Factoring - works when the equation factors nicely (e.g., x² - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3) = 0), (2) Completing the square - rewrite as (x + p)² = q and take square roots, (3) Graphing - find where the parabola crosses the x-axis, (4) Square root method - for equations like x² = 9. Factoring is fastest when applicable, but the quadratic formula always works.",
    "faqQ4": "What do the coefficients a, b, and c tell us?",
    "faqA4": "The coefficient 'a' determines the parabola's direction (up if positive, down if negative) and width (larger |a| means narrower). The coefficient 'b' affects the horizontal position of the vertex and axis of symmetry through x = -b/2a. The coefficient 'c' is the y-intercept - where the parabola crosses the y-axis (at point (0, c)). Together, they completely determine the parabola's shape and position.",
    "faqQ5": "What are some real-world applications of quadratic equations?",
    "faqA5": "Quadratics model many phenomena: projectile motion (height vs. time for thrown objects), profit/revenue optimization (maximum profit at optimal price), area problems (maximizing enclosed area with fixed perimeter), physics (kinetic energy, lens equations), engineering (arch bridges, satellite dishes), and economics (supply-demand equilibrium). The vertex often represents the maximum or minimum of whatever is being modeled.",
    "faqQ6": "What's the difference between roots, zeros, and x-intercepts?",
    "faqA6": "These terms are closely related but used in different contexts. 'Roots' or 'solutions' are values of x that satisfy the equation ax² + bx + c = 0. 'Zeros' are values where the function f(x) = ax² + bx + c equals zero. 'X-intercepts' are points where the graph crosses the x-axis, written as (x, 0). For real roots, all three concepts give the same x-values. Complex roots are solutions/zeros but don't correspond to x-intercepts since they're not real numbers."

Probability theory is fundamental to statistics, gambling, science, artificial intelligence, and everyday decision-making. The probability of an event E, written as P(E), can be calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes when all outcomes are equally likely.

    "faqA2": "Independent events don't affect each other's probability - coin flips are independent because one flip doesn't change the next. Dependent events affect each other - drawing cards without replacement is dependent because each draw changes the remaining possibilities. For independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B). For dependent events, you need P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A), where P(B|A) is the probability of B given that A happened.",
    "faqQ3": "What is conditional probability?",
    "faqA3": "Conditional probability P(B|A) is the probability of B occurring given that A has already occurred. For example, P(heart | red card) = 1/2 because half of the red cards are hearts.

    "faqA4": "Use AND (intersection, P(A∩B)) when you want BOTH events to happen - like rolling two 6s in a row, or picking a card that's both red AND a face card. Use OR (union, P(A∪B)) when you want AT LEAST ONE to happen - like rolling a 6 OR a 5, or picking a card that's red OR a face card. AND typically gives smaller probabilities, OR gives larger probabilities.",
    "faqQ5": "What is the complement of an event?",
    "faqA5": "The complement of event A (written as A' or 'not A') includes all outcomes where A doesn't happen. Since something either happens or it doesn't, P(A) + P(A') = 1, so P(A') = 1 - P(A). Complements are useful when it's easier to calculate 'not happening' - for example, P(at least one head in 3 flips) is easier calculated as 1 - P(all tails) = 1 - (1/2)³ = 7/8.",
    "faqQ6": "What's the Gambler's Fallacy?",
    "faqA6": "The Gambler's Fallacy is the mistaken belief that past random events affect future probabilities. After flipping 10 heads in a row, the probability of the next flip being heads is still exactly 50% - coins have no memory. Similarly, 'hot' or 'cold' streaks in gambling are psychological, not statistical. Each independent event has the same probability regardless of what came before.

A COMBINATION is a selection of items where ORDER DOESN'T MATTER - choosing cards A, B, C is the same as choosing C, B, A. A PERMUTATION is an arrangement where ORDER MATTERS - the password ABC is different from CBA. Factorials (n!) are the building blocks for both calculations, representing the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. These concepts are essential in probability, statistics, cryptography, and computer science. For example, lottery odds use combinations (order of numbers drawn doesn't matter), while arranging books on a shelf uses permutations (order matters).",

    "faqQ3": "Why is 0! equal to 1?",
    "faqA3": "This is defined mathematically for consistency. One way to understand it: n! represents the number of ways to arrange n items. There's exactly ONE way to arrange zero items - do nothing. Also, the formula n! = n × (n-1)! requires 0! = 1 to work for 1! = 1 × 0! = 1.

    "whatIsContent": "A z-score (also called standard score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It standardizes values from any normal distribution to a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). Z-scores are fundamental in statistics for comparing values from different distributions, finding percentiles, and calculating probabilities. A positive z-score means the value is above the mean, while a negative z-score means it's below. About 68% of data falls within ±1 standard deviation (z between -1 and 1), 95% within ±2, and 99.7% within ±3 - this is the empirical rule or 68-95-99.7 rule.",
    "formulaTitle": "Z-Score Formulas",
    "formulaContent": "Z-SCORE FORMULA: Z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the raw score, μ (mu) is the population mean, and σ (sigma) is the standard deviation. This transforms any value to its position on the standard normal distribution. REVERSE FORMULA: X = μ + Z × σ converts a z-score back to the original scale. PROBABILITY: The cumulative distribution function Φ(z) gives the probability that a random value is less than or equal to z. For example, Φ(0) = 0.5 (50% of values are below the mean), Φ(1.96) ≈ 0.975 (97.5% below), and Φ(-1.96) ≈ 0.025 (2.5% below). The area between two z-scores gives the probability of falling in that range.",

    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What does a z-score of 0 mean?",
    "faqA1": "A z-score of 0 means the value is exactly at the mean. Since z = (X - μ) / σ, when X equals the mean (μ), the numerator becomes 0, so z = 0. This is the center of the normal distribution. Approximately 50% of values fall below and 50% above a z-score of 0.",
    "faqQ2": "What is a 'good' or 'bad' z-score?",
    "faqA2": "It depends on context. In testing, higher is usually better, so z = 2 (top ~2.3%) is excellent. In manufacturing, z-scores near 0 indicate products close to target specifications. In statistics, z-scores beyond ±2 are often considered unusual (outside 95% of data), and beyond ±3 are rare outliers (outside 99.7%). 'Six Sigma' quality aims for defect rates at z = ±6.",
    "faqQ3": "How do I interpret percentiles from z-scores?",
    "faqA3": "A percentile tells you what percentage of the distribution falls below your value. Z = 0 → 50th percentile (average), Z = 1 → 84th percentile, Z = 2 → 98th percentile, Z = -1 → 16th percentile, Z = -2 → 2nd percentile. For example, if your SAT score has z = 1.5, you scored higher than about 93% of test-takers.",
    "faqQ4": "Can z-scores be greater than 3 or less than -3?",
    "faqA4": "Yes, but they're rare in normally distributed data. Only about 0.3% of values fall beyond ±3 standard deviations. However, in large datasets or non-normal distributions, extreme z-scores are more common. Values beyond ±3 are often investigated as potential outliers or data errors, though they can be legitimate in some contexts.",
    "faqQ5": "What's the difference between z-score and t-score?",
    "faqA5": "Z-scores use the standard normal distribution and assume you know the population standard deviation. T-scores use the t-distribution and are used when working with sample standard deviations, especially with small samples (n < 30). As sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. T-tests use t-scores; z-tests use z-scores.",
    "faqQ6": "Why is the normal distribution so important?",
    "faqA6": "The normal distribution appears naturally in many phenomena (heights, test scores, measurement errors) due to the Central Limit Theorem: when you average many random factors, the result tends toward normal distribution. This makes z-scores universally applicable for comparing data, calculating probabilities, and making statistical inferences. Many statistical tests assume normality.",

Developed by William Sealy Gosset under the pseudonym 'Student' in 1908, it's one of the most common statistical tests. The ONE-SAMPLE t-test compares a sample mean to a known or hypothesized population mean. The TWO-SAMPLE (independent) t-test compares means of two separate groups. The PAIRED t-test compares means from the same group at different times or under different conditions.

    "faqA1": "Use a t-test when you're working with sample data and don't know the population standard deviation (which is almost always the case). Z-tests require knowing the population standard deviation and are mainly used with very large samples (n > 30) or when testing proportions. For most practical purposes involving means, t-tests are the appropriate choice.",
    "faqQ2": "What's the difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests?",
    "faqA2": "A two-tailed test checks if there's any difference (higher or lower), while a one-tailed test only checks for difference in one direction. Use two-tailed when you just want to know if groups differ. Use one-tailed only when you have a specific directional hypothesis before collecting data (e.g., 'the new drug will increase scores'). Two-tailed is more conservative and generally preferred.",
    "faqQ3": "What does the p-value mean?",
    "faqA3": "The p-value is the probability of getting results as extreme as yours if there were actually no difference (null hypothesis true). A small p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests the difference is unlikely due to chance alone, so we 'reject the null hypothesis.' It does NOT tell you the size or importance of the effect, just whether it's statistically detectable.",
    "faqQ4": "What are degrees of freedom?",
    "faqA4": "Degrees of freedom (df) represent the number of independent pieces of information in your data. For a one-sample t-test, df = n - 1 because once you know the mean and n-1 values, the last value is determined. More df means the t-distribution is closer to normal. The df affects the critical values and p-value calculation.",
    "faqQ5": "When should I use paired vs independent t-tests?",
    "faqA5": "Use paired t-test when measurements come from the same subjects (before/after studies, matched pairs, repeated measures). Use independent (two-sample) t-test when comparing two separate groups of different subjects. Paired tests are more powerful because they control for individual variation, but require the paired relationship to be meaningful.",
    "faqQ6": "What if my data isn't normally distributed?",
    "faqA6": "T-tests are fairly robust to mild violations of normality, especially with larger samples (n > 30) due to the Central Limit Theorem. For severely non-normal data with small samples, consider: (1) transforming the data (log, square root), (2) using non-parametric alternatives like Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or (3) bootstrapping methods.",

Discovered by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, it states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to its resistance. The formula V = I × R is the foundation of circuit analysis. Combined with the power equation P = V × I, these relationships allow us to calculate any electrical quantity when two others are known. Ohm's Law applies to 'ohmic' materials where resistance remains constant regardless of voltage.",

Resistance opposes the flow of current. POWER (P): P = V × I = V² / R = I² × R. Measured in Watts (W). Power is the rate of energy transfer.

    "faqQ1": "Why doesn't Ohm's Law work for all components?",
    "faqA1": "Ohm's Law only applies to 'ohmic' or 'linear' components where resistance stays constant regardless of voltage or current. Many real components are 'non-ohmic': diodes conduct in one direction only, LEDs need minimum voltage to turn on, incandescent bulbs change resistance with temperature, and transistors have complex V-I relationships. For these, we use more complex models or measure V-I curves directly.",
    "faqQ2": "What's the difference between AC and DC for Ohm's Law?",
    "faqA2": "Ohm's Law V = IR applies directly to DC (direct current) circuits. For AC (alternating current), we replace resistance with 'impedance' (Z), which includes resistance plus the effects of capacitors and inductors. The formula becomes V = IZ. AC calculations also involve phase angles and often use complex numbers or phasor notation.",
    "faqQ3": "How do I calculate power dissipation for component selection?",
    "faqA3": "Use P = I²R or P = V²/R to find power dissipation. Always choose components rated higher than calculated - typically 2x for safety margin. For example, if a resistor dissipates 0.3W, use at least a 0.5W or 1W rated resistor. Excess power becomes heat, which can damage components or cause fires.",
    "faqQ4": "What happens if resistance is zero?",
    "faqA4": "If R = 0 (a short circuit), Ohm's Law predicts infinite current (I = V/0). In reality, current is limited by wire resistance, power source limitations, and safety devices like fuses or circuit breakers. Short circuits are dangerous - they cause extreme heating, fires, and equipment damage. This is why overcurrent protection is essential in all circuits.",
    "faqQ5": "How do series and parallel circuits affect calculations?",
    "faqA5": "In SERIES: resistances add (R_total = R1 + R2 + ...), current is the same through all components, voltages add up to total. In PARALLEL: use 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ..., voltage is the same across all branches, currents add up to total. Power in both cases: P_total = P1 + P2 + ...

    "whatIsContent": "Density is a fundamental physical property that measures how much mass is contained in a given volume. Defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = m/V), density determines whether objects float or sink, how materials respond to forces, and their thermal properties. First precisely formulated by Archimedes around 250 BC through his famous bath discovery, density is measured in kg/m³ (SI units), though g/cm³ and lb/ft³ are also common. Water has a density of 1000 kg/m³ (1 g/cm³) at 4°C, which serves as a convenient reference point. Different materials have vastly different densities: osmium (22,590 kg/m³) is the densest naturally occurring element, while hydrogen gas (0.09 kg/m³) is among the least dense. Density is crucial in fields from materials science to oceanography, helping us understand why ice floats, how submarines control buoyancy, and which materials are best for specific engineering applications.",

    "faqA1": "Objects float when their average density is less than the fluid they're in, and sink when denser. A steel ship floats despite steel's high density (7850 kg/m³) because its hollow hull creates an average density less than water (1000 kg/m³). Ice floats on water because ice is less dense (917 kg/m³) - unusual since most solids are denser than their liquid form. Hot air balloons rise because heated air is less dense than cool air.",
    "faqQ2": "Does density change with temperature or pressure?",
    "faqA2": "Yes! For most materials, density decreases as temperature increases (thermal expansion). Water is unusual - it's densest at 4°C and expands both when cooled (forming ice) and heated. Gases are highly compressible, so their density changes dramatically with pressure (ideal gas: ρ ∝ P/T). Liquids and solids compress much less, with density changes typically <1% even at extreme pressures.",

Force is measured in Newtons (N) in the SI system, named after Sir Isaac Newton who formulated the laws of motion in 1687. One Newton is the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass by 1 m/s². Forces are vectors, meaning they have both magnitude and direction. Common examples include gravity (weight = mg, where g ≈ 9.8 m/s² on Earth), friction, tension, normal force, and applied forces. Understanding force is essential for analyzing motion in mechanics, engineering, sports, and everyday life - from why cars need brakes to how rockets launch into space.",
    "formulaTitle": "Newton's Second Law Formula",
    "formulaContent": "BASIC FORMULA: F = m × a, where F is force (Newtons), m is mass (kilograms), and a is acceleration (meters per second squared). CALCULATE FORCE: F = m × a. A 10 kg object accelerating at 5 m/s² experiences 50 N of force. CALCULATE MASS: m = F / a. A 100 N force causing 2 m/s² acceleration acts on a 50 kg mass. CALCULATE ACCELERATION: a = F / m. A 60 N force on a 20 kg object produces 3 m/s² acceleration. WEIGHT CALCULATION: Weight is a special case where a = g (gravitational acceleration ≈ 9.8 m/s² on Earth). Weight (N) = mass (kg) × 9.8. A 70 kg person weighs 686 N. NET FORCE: When multiple forces act on an object, calculate the net (total) force by vector addition. F_net determines acceleration via F_net = m × a.",

    "examplesContent": "EXAMPLE 1: A car with mass 1500 kg accelerates from rest to 20 m/s in 10 seconds. What force does the engine apply? a = (20-0)/10 = 2 m/s². F = 1500 × 2 = 3000 N. EXAMPLE 2: A person weighs 180 N on the Moon (g = 1.6 m/s²). What's their mass? m = F/a = 180/1.6 = 112.5 kg. Same person on Earth weighs 112.5 × 9.8 = 1102.5 N. EXAMPLE 3: A 5000 N rocket force acts on a 500 kg spacecraft in space. What's the acceleration? a = 5000/500 = 10 m/s². EXAMPLE 4: Brakes apply 8000 N force to stop a 1600 kg car. Deceleration = 8000/1600 = 5 m/s² (negative acceleration).",
    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "What's the difference between mass and weight?",
    "faqA1": "Mass is the amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms (kg), and is constant everywhere in the universe. Weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass, measured in Newtons (N), and varies with gravitational field strength. Weight = mass × g. A 70 kg person has mass 70 kg everywhere, but weighs 686 N on Earth (g=9.8), 115 N on the Moon (g=1.6), and nearly 0 N in deep space. Weight changes, mass doesn't.",
    "faqQ2": "Can force exist without acceleration?",
    "faqA2": "Yes! Multiple forces can act on an object with zero net force, producing no acceleration (Newton's First Law - equilibrium). For example, a book resting on a table experiences downward gravitational force (weight) and upward normal force from the table. These equal and opposite forces cancel out (F_net = 0), so a = 0. The object remains at rest or moves at constant velocity. Force exists, but balanced forces produce zero acceleration.",
    "faqQ3": "What are common types of forces?",
    "faqA3": "GRAVITY: F = mg pulls objects toward Earth (or other masses). NORMAL: Perpendicular contact force from surfaces. FRICTION: Opposes sliding motion, F_friction ≤ μN. TENSION: Pull force through ropes/cables. APPLIED: Push/pull forces we directly exert. AIR RESISTANCE/DRAG: Opposes motion through fluids. SPRING: F = -kx (Hooke's Law). ELECTROMAGNETIC: Forces between charges and magnets. All forces cause acceleration according to F = ma.",
    "faqQ4": "How do you handle multiple forces?",
    "faqA4": "Add forces as vectors to find net force (F_net), then use F_net = ma. SAME DIRECTION: Add magnitudes (100N + 50N right = 150N right). OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS: Subtract (100N right - 60N left = 40N right). PERPENDICULAR: Use Pythagorean theorem (30N north + 40N east = √(30²+40²) = 50N at angle). For 2D problems, break forces into x and y components, sum separately, then recombine. The net force determines acceleration direction and magnitude.",
    "faqQ5": "Why is F=ma so important?",
    "faqA5": "F = ma is one of the most fundamental equations in physics, connecting force (cause) to motion (effect). It explains everything from why heavy objects are hard to push to how spacecraft maneuver in orbit. Applications include: vehicle design (braking distances), sports (ball trajectories), engineering (structural loads), rocket science (thrust calculations), and safety (crash forces, airbag timing). Understanding F = ma is essential for all mechanics and is the foundation of classical physics.",
    "faqQ6": "What happens when mass or force is zero?",
    "faqA6": "If F = 0: No net force means a = 0 (Newton's First Law). Object maintains constant velocity (rest or uniform motion). If m = 0: Theoretically a = F/0 = infinite acceleration - physically meaningless since all matter has mass. Even photons (zero rest mass) follow different rules (E=mc²). If a = 0: Either F = 0 (equilibrium) or object moves at constant velocity. Zero acceleration doesn't mean zero velocity! These special cases reveal the boundaries of classical mechanics.",

    "faqQ1": "What's the difference between speed and velocity?",
    "faqA1": "SPEED is scalar (magnitude only): \"50 km/h\" tells how fast you're going. VELOCITY is vector (magnitude + direction): \"50 km/h north\" tells both speed and direction. You can change velocity without changing speed (driving in a circle at constant 50 km/h - speed constant, velocity constantly changing due to direction change). Average speed = total distance/time. Average velocity = displacement/time (can be zero if you return to start!). In physics calculations, velocity's direction matters for vector addition.",

    "faqA2": "COMMON CONVERSIONS: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h (multiply by 3.6), 1 km/h = 0.278 m/s (divide by 3.6), 1 mph = 0.447 m/s = 1.609 km/h, 1 m/s = 2.237 mph. CONVERSION METHOD: Use dimensional analysis. Example: Convert 60 mph to m/s: 60 mph × (1.609 km/1 mi) × (1000 m/1 km) × (1 h/3600 s) = 26.8 m/s. Always check units cancel properly. For quick estimates: km/h ≈ mph × 1.6, m/s ≈ mph × 0.45.",
    "faqQ3": "What is average speed vs instantaneous speed?",
    "faqA3": "AVERAGE SPEED: Total distance divided by total time. Example: Drive 100 km in 2 hours = 50 km/h average, even if you stopped, sped up, slowed down. INSTANTANEOUS SPEED: Speed at a specific moment, what your speedometer shows. In calculus: v = lim(Δt→0) Δd/Δt = dd/dt. For constant speed, average = instantaneous. For variable speed, they differ. Your trip computer shows both: current speed (instantaneous) and average trip speed. Physics problems often need to specify which type.",

    "faqA6": "RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS (near light speed): Time dilation (moving clocks run slow), length contraction (moving objects shorten), mass increase. Classical v = d/t breaks down - need Einstein's relativity. Nothing with mass can reach light speed (c). SPEED OF LIGHT: Absolute limit, same in all reference frames (299,792,458 m/s). Spacecraft: Current max ~17 km/s (Voyager), orders of magnitude below c. At everyday speeds (<1000 m/s), classical physics works perfectly.

    "faqA1": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. Total energy in a closed system remains constant. Examples: Pendulum swings convert PE ↔ KE continuously. Falling object: PE → KE as it falls. Friction converts KE → heat energy. Battery: Chemical energy → electrical energy → light + heat. Nuclear: Mass energy (E=mc²) → heat → electricity. Energy 'loss' means conversion to less useful forms (usually heat), not destruction. This is one of the most fundamental laws in physics, with NO known violations.",
    "faqQ2": "Why does kinetic energy depend on velocity squared?",
    "faqA2": "KE = ½mv² has v² because accelerating requires work, and work over distance adds up. INTUITION: Doubling speed requires 4× energy because you must accelerate through twice the distance at higher average speed. DERIVATION: Work = Force × distance = (ma) × d. From kinematics: v² = 2ad, so d = v²/(2a). Thus Work = ma × v²/(2a) = ½mv². CONSEQUENCE: High speeds are energy-intensive. Going 100→120 mph requires more energy than 0→20 mph. This is why fuel efficiency drops at high speeds and why crashes are exponentially more dangerous at higher speeds.",

    "faqA3": "They constantly transform into each other while conserving total energy. FALLING OBJECT: Starts with PE = mgh, KE = 0.

Example: Pushing a box 10m with 50N force at 0° angle: W = 50 × 10 × cos(0°) = 500 J. Carrying a box horizontally: gravity does no work because force (down) is perpendicular to motion (horizontal)."

A 1,000 kg car at 20 m/s has KE = ½(1000)(20²) = 200,000 J. At 40 m/s, KE = 800,000 J (4× more energy). Kinetic energy is always positive (v² is always positive) and is measured in Joules.",

    "formulaContent": "KE = ½mv². Why v²? Because accelerating requires work, and work accumulates over distance. INTUITION: Doubling speed requires 4× energy because you must accelerate through twice the distance at higher average velocity. DERIVATION: Work = Force × distance = (ma) × d. From kinematics: v² = 2ad, so d = v²/(2a). Thus Work = ma × v²/(2a) = ½mv². CONSEQUENCE: High speeds are energy-intensive. Going from 100→120 km/h requires more energy than 0→20 km/h. This is why fuel efficiency drops at high speeds and accidents are exponentially more dangerous at higher velocities."

          "question": "Why don't we see waves for large objects?",
          "answer": "Because Planck's constant (h) is extremely small. For a large mass (like a car), the resulting wavelength is so incredibly tiny that it cannot be measured or observed. For tiny masses like electrons, the wavelength is comparable to atomic scales."

        {
          "question": "What does this wavelength mean?",
          "answer": "According to quantum mechanics, it represents the probability wave of the particle's position. It is verified experimentally through diffraction patterns, such as in Electron Microscopy."

        {
          "question": "What happens if velocity is zero?",
          "answer": "If velocity is zero, the wavelength is mathematically undefined (infinite). A particle must be in motion to exhibit a measurable de Broglie wavelength."
