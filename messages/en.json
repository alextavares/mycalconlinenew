  "faqTitle": "Frequently asked questions about compound interest",
  "faqQ1": "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?",
  "faqA1": "With simple interest, interest is always calculated only on the initial principal. With compound interest, interest is calculated on the updated balance (principal + accumulated interest), which accelerates growth over time.",
  "faqQ2": "Why does compounding frequency matter?",
  "faqA2": "Compounding frequency defines how often interest is applied (monthly, annually, etc.). For the same nominal annual rate, more frequent compounding generally leads to a higher final amount.",
